# 🏠 House Price Prediction – India

This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning models on a dataset of 14K+ records from the Indian housing market.

---

### 🔍 Project Overview

Built a supervised regression model pipeline in Python to estimate house prices. Applied full data preprocessing, handled outliers using **Boxplot & IQR**, performed EDA, feature engineering, and compared multiple ML algorithms to find the best-performing model.

---

### 📂 Dataset

- **File:** `House Price India.csv`
- **Records:** 14,620 rows × 23 columns
- Features include bedrooms, bathrooms, lot area, living area, year built, schools nearby, and more.

---

### ⚙️ Models Used

- Linear Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Decision Tree Regressor  
- Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

---

### 📈 Techniques Applied

- Handled outliers using **Boxplot & IQR method**
- Cleaned and transformed data using Pandas
- Visualized data distribution and relationships with **Seaborn** & **Matplotlib**
- Applied **train-test split** and evaluated performance using:
  - `R² Score`
  - `Mean Squared Error (MSE)`

---

### 📊 Results & Comparison

All models were compared based on their accuracy and error metrics. Evaluation metrics were used to analyze the effectiveness of each model on unseen data.

### 💻 Files Included

- `house price.ipynb` – Full Jupyter Notebook with data cleaning, modeling, and evaluation  
- `House Price India.csv` – Dataset used for prediction
